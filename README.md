## Introduction

### Environment Setup

### `.env.example`

Use the `.env.example` placeholders as a guide.

1. **Copy the Template**: Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

2. **Fill in the Values**: See comments.

3. **Secure the File**: Ensure that the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to version control.

### Running the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs), then run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Bot**: The application will automatically generate a session string if it is not present in the `.env` file. Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured with your `API_ID` and `API_HASH`. You can start the bot using:

   ```bash
   node src/index.js
   ```

   The bot will connect to Telegram and start listening for commands.

3. **Using the Bot**: The bot can handle commands sent to it. For example, you can use the `/set` command to update configuration values dynamically. The bot will respond with confirmation messages.

4. **Running the Server**: If your application includes a server component, you can start it using:

   ```bash
   node src/bot/server.js
   ```

   The server will listen for incoming requests and process them accordingly.

### Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the test suite located in `src/tests/test_main.js`, which includes tests for the Telegram client initialization and authentication.
